# InsightMiner: Academic Document QA and Content Retrieval Using Data Science Techniques

**Objective**:

To build a retrieval-based QA system that parses academic PDFs, embeds the content, and retrieves relevant segments in response to user queries.

**Goals**:

- Extract and chunk text from PDFs
- Generate and index text embeddings (using FAISS)
- Perform document search using similarity scores
- Evaluate retrieval precision or answer relevance
- Optional: summarization using extractive or LLM-based methods
- Datasets: [ArXiv Academic Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv), such as titles, authors, abstracts, categories
